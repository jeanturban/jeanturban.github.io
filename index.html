                    Now I'm here: an undergrad at Caltech majoring in Mechanical Engineering and minoring in Computer Science.
                    I have a heavy interest in robotics (which spurred the major/minor combo) and love being able to design and prototype an idea from all fronts.

                            <h2>The Great Wave</h2>
                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">3D Stencil on Acrylic Sheets</p>
                            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/Current/greatwave.jpg" alt="">
                            <p>This is a stencil I made during my free time this past summer. There were two aspects involved in creating it: the art and the mechanical.</p>
                            <p>I designed the stencil based on Hokusai's "The Great Wave of Kanagawa" - a rather well know piece of art. Using open source image editors such as GIMP and
                              Inkscape I converted the original piece into having 4 colors only and adjusted the image so that it would be suitable for cutting out. All in all, I am pretty
                              happy with the final look of the stencil in that it is visually pleasing and minimal, all while keeping resemblance to the original piece.</p>
                            <p>The mechanical aspect involved essentially dealt with making a 3D "canvas" for me to paint on. The idea that led me to paint on acrylic panels
                              was that I could layer them such that it would give the painting more depth. In order to do this I simply cut 4 sheets of acrylic to the appropriate size
                              and cut holes in the corners so that rods could go through them. All of this was done with the laser cutter at my school. Following this, I cut 4 steel rods
                              to the size I wanted (about 4 inches) so that I could line all the panels up and connect them to one another. The last thing I should mention is that I made
                              circular "spacers" out of acrylic to place between panels such that the panels could not wiggle back and forth on the rod.</p>
                            <p>I painted one layer per panel and then layed all the panels and spacers from the bottom (back) up. I used a small amount of acrylic glue to bond the spacers
                              and panels so that the entire frame was firm. The rods were slotted through the panels and the spacers and ensured that everything was lined up</p>
                              <p>All in all, I am quite happy with the end result. The colors are bright and pop out really well in lit environments so that's a definite plus.
                              Furthermore, I think my desired effect of depth was achieved and that the stencil turned out great! As a last remark, I think it's worth noting that
                              I experienced minor inaccurices with all the slop from the laser cutter but I was able to get around it by widening the holes in the spacers. </p>

                            <h2>Voice Responsive Light Switcher</h2>
                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">Powered by Arduino</p>
                            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/Current/light2.JPG" alt="">
                            <p>This is a project I designed and built for a class. The idea behind it was that I wanted to be able to turn off my lights while laying down in my lofted bed</p>
                            <p>As a Mechanical Engineer, I decided to try to apply some of what I had learned in class in designing this. This is the main reason as to why I simply didn't solve
                              my problem using fancy wiring (a break in the circuit activated by voice doesn't sound too hard). One of the major factors I considered was the force required to
                              bring down the switch. I attempted to measure this using a makeshift experiment since I did not have a fish-scale of sorts available. My idea behind the experiment
                              was basically to attach small weights on a string to the switch until it flipped down. I rounded this estimate up to the nearest multiple of 10 and made that my upped bound
                              for my calculations - basically if I designed my mechanism such that it could work on the upper bound, then I should be good!</p>

                            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/Current/light1.JPG" alt="">

                            <p>Knowing the force needed to flip the switch, I worked backwards to figure out the right torque the cam-gear would need. Furthermore, I kept working backwards to figure out
                            what gear ratio would suit my needs in respect to torque, force, and also angle. Since I was planning on using a servo motor which only rotates a total of 90 degrees to each side, I had to make sure the gear ratio would allow for
                            enough rotation of the cam-gear when flipping the switch up or down.</p>

                            <p>In the end, I decided on the gear ratio based on how much space I needed between the servo motor (1st shaft), and the cam-gear (2nd shaft). This can be seen in the second picture. Basically, the position of the
                              cam-gear had to be fixed around the center of the light switch, thus given the size of the height/width of the servo motor, there were few gear combinations that made sense. I could have technically
                              made the box taller as needed to fit bigger gears, but I tried to reduce space where possible. I made sure that this new gear ratio
                            would still work, but it was not the ideal ratio I had originally calculated.</p>

                            <p>The electronic side of the project was done using an Arduino and a Voice Shield for the Arduino (both not pictured). Wiring and programming the Arduino was
                              fairly straight forward since there is such expansive documentation onlnine. The space next to the servo motor is where both of these things fit.

                            <h2>JPL's Starshade</h2>
                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">A space occulter used to hunt for new planets</p>
                            <p> In the summer of 2014 I interned at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) for 10 weeks working on Project Starshade. I am not too sure how much I can disclose regarding my work so instead I have written up a general overview of what the project is. Most of the information below can readily be found online. </p>
                            <p>A starshade, also dubbed an external occulter, is a precisely shaped screen that flies in far-away formation with a space telescope. The device blocks a star's light to create a high-contrast shadow, so that only light from an orbiting exoplanet enters the telescope for detailed study. The starshade has flower shaped petals which are patterned in a very precise manner to reduce the bending of light waves. Advantages of the starshade include its versatility (the starshade could be use with most current telescopes) and the fact that it encourages simpler future telescope designs (since they would not have to deal with light from the star). Despite the benefits, there are challenges in the form of precision: the starshade must launch and deploy so that everything ends up in the right place - within millimeters. Achieving such tolerances is more impressive when you consider the fact that the starshade could be over 100 feet.</p>
                            <p>This concept has moved beyond the drawing board at JPL and as part of the process, I helped show part of the starshades feasibility. Specifically, I helped show that the necessary ring truss could be created and deployed to within the desired tolerances. My work primarily included building the truss and designing procedures for ease of repeatibilty.</p>
                            <p>A released photo of my work this summer can be seen below. The ring truss originally stows in the center cylinder and deploys to the seen full position.</p>

                            <img class="img-responsive" align="center" src="img/Current/climbing.jpg" alt=""/>
                            <p class="lead">I was born in Switzerland, grew up in Mexico, and later moved to Miami, Florida.
                            Now I'm here: an undergrad at Caltech majoring in Mechanical Engineering and minoring in Computer Science.
                            I have a heavy interest in robotics (which spurred the major/minor combo) and love being able to design and prototype an idea from all fronts.
                            If you would like to know more about me academically, feel free to connect with me on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/jean-alexandre-turban/87/8b4/833">LinkedIn</a>

                            <p class="lead">When I am not solving problem sets and studying, I love nothing more than traveling, playing sports, and dabbling in my interests:
                            I have backpacked the Swiss Alps, competed in triathlons, seen the sun rise over Angkor, and driven through the US.
                            These days, my free time tends to be filled with one of the following: bouldering, reading, stenciling, being with friends, or learning something interesting (such as the principles of algorithmic trading!)
